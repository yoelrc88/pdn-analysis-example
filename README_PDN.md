# PDN Impedance Analysis Notebook

This repository now includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook (`pdn_impedance_analysis.ipynb`) that demonstrates Power Delivery Network (PDN) impedance analysis using scikit-rf.

## New Features

### PDN Impedance Analysis Notebook

The new notebook includes:

- **Educational Structure**: Step-by-step explanation of PDN analysis theory and implementation
- **Comprehensive Comments**: Detailed explanations of each function and calculation
- **Synthetic Component Models**: Realistic capacitor and VRM models for demonstration
- **Intermediate Plots**: Visualization at each step of the analysis
- **Engineering Insights**: Target compliance analysis and recommendations
- **Professional Visualizations**: Publication-ready plots with proper labeling

### Key Capabilities

1. **Multi-Component PDN Analysis**
   - PDN 2-port models (plane/package)
   - Multiple capacitor types with realistic parasitics
   - VRM modeling (R-L, S1P, or S2P options)

2. **Numerically Stable Y-Space Calculations**
   - Admittance-based approach for milliohm-level impedances
   - Proper network renormalization to 1Î© reference

3. **Comprehensive Output**
   - Driving-point impedance magnitude and phase
   - Return loss characteristics
   - Component contribution analysis
   - Final 1-port .s1p model for further use

4. **Educational Value**
   - Theory explanations for each section
   - Engineering insights and recommendations
   - Clear code structure with good commenting

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scikit-rf matplotlib jupyter nbformat nbconvert
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook pdn_impedance_analysis.ipynb
   ```

3. Run all cells to see the complete analysis

## Adapting for Real-World Use

To use with your actual PDN data:

1. **Replace PDN Model**: Change `PDN_S2P = "your_pdn_model.s2p"`
2. **Use Real Capacitor Data**: Replace synthetic models with actual S2P files
3. **Load VRM Data**: Use measured VRM output impedance (S1P or S2P)
4. **Adjust Targets**: Set appropriate impedance targets for your application
5. **Extend Analysis**: Add temperature/process variations as needed

## Example Output Files

The notebook generates:
- `pdn_die_driving_point_1ohm.s1p` - Final 1-port model
- Multiple PNG plots showing analysis results
- Engineering summary with compliance analysis

## Original Touchstone Plotting

The original `plot_sparameters.ipynb` remains available for basic S-parameter visualization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- scikit-rf
- matplotlib  
- jupyter
- numpy

See `pdn_impedance_analysis.ipynb` for the complete implementation with hood comments and intermediate plots as requested.
